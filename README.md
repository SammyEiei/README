# Olympic Medal Data Model

This project represents data about Olympic medal standings for various countries and their achievements in different sports. The data is structured in two main entities: `Country` and `SportDetail`, with each country containing information about the sports in which they won medals.

## Data Model

- **Bronze** (Number): The number of bronze medals won by the country.
- **Total** (Number): The total number of medals won by the country.

### 2. SportDetail
The `SportDetail` entity holds information about the sports in which each country won medals, along with the rank achieved and a representation of the medals.

#### Properties:
- **ID** (Number): Unique identifier for each sport detail.
- **Country ID** (Relation to Country): Foreign key linking the sport details to the corresponding country.
- **Sport Name** (Text): The name of the sport in which the medals were won.
- **Rank** (Number): The rank achieved by the country in that sport.
- **Medals URL** (Text/Emoji): A representation of the medal won (can be an emoji or URL).
